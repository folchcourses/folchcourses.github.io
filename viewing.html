        <h1>Viewing a Course Repository</h1>

    The course repository is located in a private organizational account in
    the GitHub cloud.  This means that it can only be viewed by invited GitHub
    users, i.e., students in the class. During the initial weeks of the course
    you will only be reading and "pulling" from the GitHub course repository. As we move
    into the project phase you will start to <a href="workflow.html" >add
    content</a> to your GitHub repository. <p>


     <h2>Github account</h2>
     By now you should have done these things:<p>
             <ol>
             <li>Signed up for an account on Github </li>
             <li>Requested and received educational status with Github </li>
             <li>Sent me your Github user name </li>
             <li>Accepted my invitation to join the <tt>folchcourses</tt> Github organization </li>
             </ol>
             If you have not done all of these, <a href="new_account.html" target="_blank" >follow the steps here</a>.
        <p>

     <h2>Viewing the course repository online</h2>
             In what follows we will be using the example of a student named
             <tt>Joe Johnson</tt>, with the Github user name of <tt>geonole</tt>. You
         should replace this with your GitHub user name in the steps that
         follow.<p>

    
     <ol>
     <li>Login to Github</li>
     <li>Click your user name in the upper-right corner. <a href="images/wf_step2.png" >example</a></li>
     <li>Click the <tt>folchcourses</tt> icon in the lower-left corner. <a href="images/wf_step3.png" >example</a></li>
     <li>Click the repository with your course name, semester and year. <a href="images/view_1.png" >example</a></li>
     <li>Here you will find the syllabus, homework exercises and other course content. <a href="images/view_2.png" >example</a></li>
     </ol>


     <h2>Cloning the course repository to your local hard drive</h2>


     Cloning allows you to pull course content to your lab or personal
     computer. GitHub provides software to facilitate this process.

     <ul>
         <li><a href="https://mac.github.com/" >Mac</a></li>
         <li><a href="https://windows.github.com/" >Windows</a></li>
     </ul>

     Follow these steps to get started with the GUI (only the first time you use it).
     <ol>
         <li>Download the appropriate software for your computer, and install it.</li>
         <li>Startup the GUI, and follow the steps to link your GitHub account to the GUI.</li>
         <li>"Clone" the course repository to your local hard drive.</li>
     </ol>

     You can now pull (called "sync" in the software) course content and view
     it on your local machine.
