        <h1>Using ArcGIS arcpy with Anaconda Python</h1>


<img src="figures/arcpy_icon.png" style="float: right; width: 30%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;">          
    When you install ArcGIS, you also get a version of Python, a limited set
    of open source packages and ESRI's python tools, called <tt>arcpy</tt>.
    This is a very basic setup. Anaconda Python will be 
    <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/esri-selects-anaconda-enhance-gis-140100709.html">cooked into
        ArcGIS at some point</a>, but until that time you can use
    <tt>arcpy</tt> outside the ESRI environment.
    
    Regular ArcGIS installed on most machines requires 32 bit python (current
    as of ArcGIS 10.4), and we will follow that assumption in what follows.
    There are some flavors of ESRI products <a href="
    http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/arcmap/latest/analyze/executing-tools/64bit-background.htm">compatible
    with 64 bit python</a> (also <a href="https://blogs.esri.com/esri/supportcenter/2013/07/29/64-bit-vs-32-bit-python-explained/">see this</a>).

    <ul>
        <li>Follow the Anaconda steps above, except download and install
            32-bit version of Python 2.7 (or 64 bit if you have a special
            version of Arc).</li>
        <li>Copy <tt>Desktop10.4.pth</tt> which can be found in <tt>C:\Python27\ArcGIS10.4\Lib\site-packages\</tt> to
            the <tt>C:\your_user_name\Anaconda2\Lib\site-packages</tt>
            directory.
        <li>Note: The first time <tt>import arcpy</tt> is called, it will be slow.</li>
        <li>The above steps are sufficient to use arcpy outside of ArcGIS.  <a
                href="https://gisday.wordpress.com/2016/07/18/setting-up-anaconda-pysal-with-arcgis-python-environment/">This
                website</a> has a far more detailed approach that uses
            Anaconda environments. They also offer an approach to access all
            the Anaconda packages from within ArcGIS, but I was not successful
        in doing this.</li>
    </ul>
