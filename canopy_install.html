        <h1>Installing Enthought Canopy Python</h1>

Enthought Canopy is a Python distribution that bundles the Python programming
language and over 200 Python packages for scientific computing, some of which
provide spatial analysis and/or GIS functionality.<p>


     <h2>Get an Enthought Academic Account</h2>

             <ol>
             <li>Go to the <a href="https://www.enthought.com/products/epd/" target="_blank" >Enthought website</a></li>
             <li>Click <tt>Create Account</tt> in the upper-right. <a href="images/enthought1.png" >example</a> </li>
             <li>Fill in the form using your <tt>fsu.edu</tt> email account, which will facilitate getting an academic account later. </li>
             <li>Once you have completed the form, Enthought will send an activation email.  Follow the directions in this email.</li>
             <li>From the activation web page click the <tt>Request an academic license</tt> link at the bottom-left. <a href="images/enthought2.png" >example</a> </li>
             <li>On the Academic web page, click the <tt>Request your Academic License</tt> button on the bottom-left. <a href="images/enthought3.png" >example</a> </li>

             </ol>

     <h2>Downloading Enthought Canopy</h2>


     <ol>
     <li>Login to the <a href="https://www.enthought.com/products/epd/" target="_blank" >Enthought website</a></li>
     <li>Click the <tt>Downloads</tt> link on the left side. <a href="images/enthought4.png" >example</a></li>
     <li>The website will detect your operating system, and offer four different downloads: <a href="images/enthought5.png" >example</a></li>
     <ul>
         <li>32-bit Canopy Express
         <li>32-bit Canopy Full  &#8592; choose this if you're on Windows AND you want Canopy to access ArcGIS's python packages; if you have an older computer you might need this.
         <li>64-bit Canopy Express
         <li>64-bit Canopy Full  &#8592; Mac and Linux users should choose this, along with Windows users not wanting to link to ArcGIS.
     </ul>
     </ol>

     Note: Some installations of ArcGIS use 64-bit architecture and/or 64-bit
     Python code.  If you have this version of ArcGIS you probably know it,
     and should install 64-bit Canopy Full. <p>


     <h2>Installing Enthought Canopy</h2>

     <ol>
     <li>Double-click the file you downloaded and install it as you would any piece of software. Use all the defaults unless you're comfortable changing things.</li>
     <li>The software is now "installed", but is not really usable yet.</li>
     <li>Launch the Canopy application to begin the setup process. On a Mac you may need to go to the Applications folder and right-click the Canopy app and select <tt>Open</tt> (this is only required the first time).</li>
     <li>Unless you have a good reason not to, use the default location for the environment directory. <a href="images/enthought6.png" >example</a></li>
     <li>Unless you have a good reason not to, make Canopy your default Python. Click <tt>Start using Canopy</tt>. <a href="images/enthought7.png" >example</a></li>
     <li>Log in to your Enthought account in the Canopy application. <a href="images/enthought8.png" >example</a></li>
     <li>Click the <tt>Package Manager</tt> button. <a href="images/enthought9.png" >example</a></li>
     <li>Click <tt>Updates</tt> in the left pane. <a href="images/enthought10.png" >example</a>
     <li>Click the <tt>Install all Updates</tt> button in the lower-right. <a href="images/enthought11.png" >example</a></li>
     </ol>

      Congratulations, you now have a state of the art Python environment on your machine! <p>


     <h2>Playing nice with ArcGIS (optional; not needed for the course)</h2>

    When you install ArcGIS, you also get a version of Python, a limited set
    of open source packages and ESRI's packages (e.g., <tt>arcpy</tt>).  What
    you have done so far will not impact ArcGIS or the Python that comes with
    ArcGIS (at least as far as I've tested).  The following steps allow you to
    access ArcGIS's python packages AND Canopy's large set of open source
    packages in the same Python environment.  You can link Enthought Canopy
    and ArcGIS if:
     <ul>
         <li>You're on a Windows machine</li>
         <li>You installed 32-bit Enthought Canopy (in most cases)</li>
         <li>You have ArcGIS installed on your machine</li>
      </ul>

      
     <ol>
         <li>Figure out the path to the ArcGIS installation on your machine. It's probably on <tt>C:\</tt> or some directory of programs on <tt>C:\</tt>. We will call this <tt>C:\path\to\ArcGIS\</tt>.
         <li>Figure out the path to the Enthought installation on your
         machine. It's probably in your user space on <tt>C:\</tt>.
         We will call this
         <tt>C:\Users\your_name\AppData\Local\Enthought\</tt>.  If you do not
         see the <tt>AppData</tt> directory on your machine, then it is
         probably hidden; 
        <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/zxue/archive/2012/03/08/win8-howto-19-show-hidden-files-folders-and-drives.aspx"
        >follow this link to unhide it</a>.
         <li>Open a text editor (e.g., Notepad or <a
         href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/" >Notepad++</a>), and enter the
     following lines (you will replace <tt>\path\to\</tt> with the path on
     your machine):</li>
     <tt># .pth file for arcpy <br>
     C:\path\to\ArcGIS\Desktop10.1\bin <br>
     C:\path\to\ArcGIS\Desktop10.1\arcpy <br>
     C:\path\to\ArcGIS\Desktop10.1\ArcToolbox\Scripts </tt> <br>
     <li>Save the content of the text editor as <tt>zzArcGIS.pth</tt>.</li>
     <li>Move <tt>zzArcGIS.pth</tt> to
     <tt>C:\Users\your_name\AppData\Local\Enthought\Canopy32\User\lib\site-packages</tt>.
    </ol>

    You should now be able to import <tt>arcpy</tt> into you Canopy Python
    environment.  If you want more details on this process or want to import
    Canopy packages when you're in ArcGIS Python, <a
