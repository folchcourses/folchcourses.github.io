        <h1>Setting Up Github and Gitter Accounts for My Courses</h1>

        <ol>
<li>If you don't already have a Github account, <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank" >create one</a>.</li>
<ul>
  <li>I encourage you to edit your GitHub profile to include a photo or some other image to distinguish you from the masses.  <br></li>
<!--<li>(OPTIONAL) Your work in my classes will be in private repositories, meaning that it
    won't be viewable to the public at large. If you would like to make your
    own private repositories (for projects unrelated to the class) you can
    request an academic account. </li>
    <ul>
    <li>Sign into your account and <a href="https://education.github.com" target="_blank">upgrade to an academic account</a>.  Click "Request a discount".</li>
    <li>Fill out the form.</li>
    <li>Wait. It might take a week to get your academic status approved.</li>
    </ul>
-->
  </ul>
    <li>Email me your GitHub user name.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>After I recieve your email, you will receive an invitation from GitHub via email to join "folchcourses". Accept the invitation.</li>
        </ul>

  <li>If you don't already have a Gitter account, <a href="https://gitter.im/" target="_blank" >create one</a> using your GitHub account (DO NOT use your Twitter account).</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Click the "Authorize application" button. The Gitter folks ask for a bunch of permissions on your GitHub
            account. In my experience they have honored all
            the privacy settings and not messed up my repositories. <a href="https://gitter.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/200176672-Authenticating-with-GitHub">Their long explanation of permissions.</a><br></li>
        <li>To see chats for the courses' private repositories
          <ul>
            <li>Log in to the website or app</li>
            <li>Click the "Add a Room" button in the lower-left sidebar</li>
            <li>Click the "Github Private Access" button in the lower-left of the box (be sure you allow popups)</li>
            <li>Click the "Authorize application" button</li>
          </ul>
        <li>You will not see the course chat until all your GitHub stuff is setup</li>
        <li><a href="https://gitter.im/apps">Gitter Apps</a>. Gitter has
            desktop and mobile apps. Installing these apps will let you know
            when others in the group (including your instructor) have posted
            new messages. This is the primary mode of communication for the
            course, so you will need to stay current with this communication
            stream.  Technically you can do everything on
            Gitter through their website so these apps are optional, but this
            is not recommended.</li>
        </li>
        </ul>
        
    <li>Install Git software</li>
    Install software that gives command prompt access and a graphical user
    interface (GUI) to your GitHub repositories. 
    <ul>
        <li>Windows users: <a href="https://git-for-windows.github.io">Git for Windows</a>.
            Download the installer, launch it and use all the default settings.
        <li>Mac users:  <a href="https://desktop.github.com">GitHub Desktop</a>.
            <ul>
            <li>Download the app.
            <li>Drag the app from you Downloads folder to your Applications folder.
            <li>Launch the app and follow the steps (enter your GitHub
                credentials; on the next page verify that your name and
                email are correct; accept all the defaults)
            <li>Once you're past the setup pages, click GitHub Desktop
                (upper-left corner of screen), then click Install Command Line
                Tool...
            </ul>
    </ul>
    <li>Connect your laptop to GitHub</li>
    The instructor needs to add your GitHub user name to the course before you can download
    the course materials. 
    <ul>
        <li>Create a new folder on your hard drive where you want to keep
            the course materials from GitHub.
        <li>On Mac open the Terminal application (Applications > Utilities >
            Terminal) on Windows open the Command Prompt application.
        <li>Use the cd command to navigate to the new folder you just created.
        <li>When you get to the folder you just created you will "clone" the git
            repository for the course (ask instructor for URL).
    </ul>
        </ol>
